# pandas-challenge

Inside the "pandas-challenge" directory, you'll find a folder: "PyCitySchools", with contains the Jupyter Notebook file named "PyCitySchools_starter". This foledr also includes a "Resouces" folder which contains .csv files that are used within the Jupyter Notebook file.
I developed this script using Pandas in VS Code & Jupyter Notebook. When you run this code, you'll view the results as you run each cell.

In tackling this project, I utilized resources like StackOverflow, ChatGPT, and sought guidance from my TA and my Tutor.
