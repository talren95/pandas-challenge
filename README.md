Inside the "pandas-challenge" directory, you'll find a folder: "PyCitySchools", with contains the Jupyter Notebook file named "PyCitySchools_starter". This foledr also includes a "Resouces" folder which contains .csv files that are used within the Jupyter Notebook file.
I developed this script using Pandas in VS Code & Jupyter Notebook. When you run this code, you'll view the results as you run each cell.

In tackling this project, I utilized resources like StackOverflow, ChatGPT, and sought guidance from my TA and my Tutor.

# Written Report

Upon analyzing the data provided on district and charter schools along with their respective student performance, it becomes evident that charter schools consistently outperform district schools in terms of overall student success. Notably, charter schools emerge as the top performers, while district schools tend to rank lower.

Specifically, in the domains of mathematics and reading, charter schools demonstrate superior results. Their students excel in mathematics, and both types of schools exhibit commendable performance in reading, with a high percentage achieving passing grades. Despite potentially similar or even lower budgets for charter schools compared to district schools, they still manage to achieve remarkable success in terms of student success.

In conclusion, the data suggests that charter schools, despite facing potential budget constraints, excel in fostering student achievement, surpassing their district counterparts in overall performance.
