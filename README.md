Inside the "pandas-challenge" directory, you'll find a folder: "PyCitySchools", with contains the Jupyter Notebook file named "PyCitySchools_starter". This foledr also includes a "Resouces" folder which contains .csv files that are used within the Jupyter Notebook file.
I developed this script using Pandas in VS Code & Jupyter Notebook. When you run this code, you'll view the results as you run each cell.

In tackling this project, I utilized resources like StackOverflow, ChatGPT, and sought guidance from my TA and my Tutor.

# Written Report

In analyzing the data on district and charter schools along with their respective student outcomes, it becomes apparent that charter schools consistently outperform district schools in terms of overall student success. The results indicate that charter schools rank at the top, boasting a higher percentage of passing students, while district schools lag behind with lower scores.

Examining the performance of students in mathematics and reading, charter schools continue to demonstrate superiority, particularly in average math scores. However, both school types exhibit commendable performance in average reading scores and grades. Notably, despite potentially similar or even lower budgets for charter schools compared to district schools, they manage to excel in facilitating student success.

In summary, the analysis suggests that charter schools, despite potential budget constraints, have achieved remarkable success in fostering higher student passing rates, particularly in mathematics, showcasing their effectiveness compared to district schools.
